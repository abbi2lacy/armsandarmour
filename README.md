Pulling together sw versions of the csv file, for analytics and visualization
This repository is to add and compare the different software versions as they import the Arms & Armor file.  The Arms & Armor file is not a regular Excel with lots of numbers to compare and standard deviate.  But, there are some dates to compare.  I would love to break apart the dimension column, at some point.  Also I plan to put the medium column into a word cloud to determine the largest described media, Gold; Silver?

These readme files can be good to understand what is going on as well as learn git.  What about spell check: Do it on your own girl.

I'm also reminded of editing in Wik.  Same process, add, explain, save.
